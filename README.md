* **DNSTT (SlowDNS)** — DNS-based tunneling for restricted networks
* **UDPcustom** — Custom UDP-based VPN tunneling

### 🌐 Nginx Gateway Orchestration

Nginx acts as a **smart entry point** for all connections:

* Handles traffic on **ports 80 and 443**
* Automatically routes requests to the correct backend (**V2Ray/Xray**, **SSH WS**, or **Falcon Proxy**)
* Manages **SSL/TLS termination** for secure connections

**Falcon Proxy** is a built-in **WebSocket** and **SOCKS** proxy that:

* Returns **fake HTTP responses** (`101 Switching Protocols`, `200 OK`)
* Accepts **all payloads**
* Must run on **port 8080 (no SSL)** to integrate perfectly with Nginx
  *(Ensures flawless SSH WS performance on ports 80/443)*
